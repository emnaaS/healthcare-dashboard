Power BI Project: Analyzing Hospital Discharge Data Across New York State
Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital discharge data across New York State. The dataset contains information about various hospital discharges, offering valuable insights into healthcare utilization, patient outcomes, and operational efficiency. Key aspects of the dataset include diagnoses, surgical procedures, geographic trends, patient disposition, and severity of illness.

Key Features
The project focuses on the following areas:

1. Patient Diagnoses ü©∫
Analyzing the most common conditions associated with hospital discharges across the state.
2. Surgical Procedures and Surgeons üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
Highlighting trends in specific surgeries and outcomes linked to individual surgeons.
3. Geographic Areas üèôÔ∏è
Examining discharge trends across different regions in New York State.
4. Patient Disposition üö∂
Tracking the post-discharge status of patients (e.g., home, transferred to another facility, or deceased) to understand discharge patterns and patient pathways.
5. Severity of Illness üè•
Categorizing patients by illness severity, providing a deeper understanding of how critical cases impact length of stay (LOS) and costs.
Key Metrics
1. Cost per Discharge üí∞
Analyzing the financial impact of different diagnoses, procedures, and facility locations. Identifying high-cost areas and opportunities for cost optimization.
2. Average Length of Stay (LOS) üìà
Measuring LOS to evaluate patient flow and care efficiency, benchmarking facilities based on diagnosis, procedures, severity of illness, and other factors.
Dashboard Highlights
The interactive dashboard offers the following key features:

Average LOS by Diagnosis, Procedure, and Severity of Illness: Visualizes how different conditions and levels of illness severity impact the length of stay.
Cost Analysis by Region, Diagnosis, and Severity of Illness: Provides a geographic and clinical perspective on healthcare costs, highlighting high-expense areas.
Patient Disposition Trends: Analyzes where patients go after discharge, offering insights into post-hospitalization care needs across patient groups.
Influence of Surgeons and Facilities on LOS and Cost: Examines how different healthcare providers and facilities impact LOS and discharge costs.
Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI: The primary tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Power Query: Used for robust data transformation and cleaning.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for advanced calculations and metrics.
Goals and Impact
The aim of this project is to provide healthcare administrators and policymakers with actionable insights that can:

Enhance patient care.
Manage hospital resources more efficiently.
Reduce costs and improve operational efficiency across New York State‚Äôs hospitals.
How to Use the Dashboard
