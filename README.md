# Power BI Project: Analyzing Hospital Discharge Data Across New York State

## Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital discharge data across New York State. The dataset contains information about various hospital discharges, offering valuable insights into healthcare utilization, patient outcomes, and operational efficiency. Key aspects of the dataset include diagnoses, surgical procedures, regional analysis, patient disposition, and severity of illness.

## Key Features
The project focuses on the following areas:

### 1. **Patient Diagnoses ü©∫**
   - Analyzing the most common conditions associated with hospital discharges across the state.

### 2. **Geographic Areas üèôÔ∏è**
   - Examining discharge trends across different regions in New York State.

### 3. **Patient Disposition üö∂**
   - Tracking the post-discharge status of patients (e.g., home, transferred to another facility, or deceased) to understand discharge patterns and patient pathways.

### 4. **Severity of Illness üè•**
   - Categorizing patients by illness severity, providing a deeper understanding of how critical cases impact length of stay (LOS) and costs.

## Key Metrics
### 1. **Cost per Discharge üí∞**
   - Analyzing the financial impact of different diagnoses, procedures, and facility locations. Identifying high-cost areas and opportunities for cost optimization.

### 2. **Average Length of Stay (LOS) üìà**
   - Measuring LOS to evaluate patient flow and care efficiency, benchmarking facilities based on diagnosis, procedures, severity of illness, and other factors.

## Dashboards Overview

The project consists of three interactive dashboards, each focusing on different aspects of the hospital discharge data:

### 1. **Average Length of Stay Dashboard**
   - **Overview**: This dashboard provides insights into how different diagnoses, surgical procedures, and severity of illness influence the average length of stay (LOS) in hospitals across New York State.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Average LOS by Diagnosis, Procedure, and Severity of Illness**: Visualizes how various conditions and illness severities impact the length of stay.
     - **Slicer for Risk of Mortality**: Allows users to filter data based on the risk of mortality, helping to correlate LOS with patient mortality risk.

### 2. **Cost per Discharge Dashboard**
   - **Overview**: This dashboard highlights the financial aspect of hospital discharges, focusing on the cost per discharge and various influencing factors.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Cost per Discharge by Illness**: Provides insights into the cost of discharges for different illnesses and conditions.
     - **Total Hospitals per Area**: Displays the number of hospitals in each region of New York State.
     - **Total Discharges per Age Group and Gender**: Analyzes discharge trends by age group and gender.
     - **Slicer for Risk of Mortality**: Allows users to explore how risk factors influence the cost per discharge and patient outcomes.

### 3. **Key Influencers Dashboard**
   - **Overview**: This dashboard identifies the key factors affecting hospital discharge outcomes, including the length of stay and discharge costs.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Key Influencers**: Highlights the key factors that influence the length of stay and cost per discharge.
     - **Increase and Decrease Trends**: Shows the factors that lead to an increase or decrease in LOS and discharge costs, providing insights into what can be optimized to improve patient care and reduce costs.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: The primary tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Power Query**: Used for robust data transformation and cleaning.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized for advanced calculations and metrics.

## Goals and Impact
The aim of this project is to provide healthcare administrators and policymakers with actionable insights that can:
- Enhance patient care.
- Manage hospital resources more efficiently.
- Reduce costs and improve operational efficiency across New York State‚Äôs hospitals.

## How to Use the Dashboards
1. **Open the Power BI file** to view the interactive dashboards.
2. **Navigate through the tabs** to access the different dashboards.
   - **Average Length of Stay Dashboard**: Explore trends in LOS based on diagnoses, procedures, and illness severity.
   - **Cost per Discharge Dashboard**: Understand the financial aspects of discharges based on diagnosis, region, age group, and gender.
   - **Key Influencers Dashboard**: Identify the key factors that affect discharge outcomes, including LOS and cost.
3. **Use the slicers** to filter data based on the **Risk of Mortality**, allowing for deeper analysis of patient outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project serves as an important tool for understanding the factors influencing hospital discharge trends and can be used to drive improvements in patient care and hospital management. The interactive dashboards enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource allocation, cost reduction, and care optimization across New York State‚Äôs hospitals.
